## About
This little alt:V resource allows you to get the coordinates of the current aiming position plus retrieving information about an aimed at entity.

## How to use
Create a new folder in the server resources folder and copy the files into it. Add the folder name to your resources section of your server.cfg.

When you are ingame, you can just aim at some point with a weapon and press M (default key) on your keyboard. The information will be written into the console (F8 to open console).

## Configuration

In client/client.js you can change the **AIMPOS_KEY** constant to change the key binding. Use google for Javascript key codes.
